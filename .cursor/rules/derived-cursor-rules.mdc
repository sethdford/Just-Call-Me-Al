## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Goal: To create a state-of-the-art text-to-speech system that surpasses the capabilities of existing models like Sesami.ai.  This involves building a robust and efficient pipeline encompassing text processing, audio tokenization (using RVQ), and high-fidelity audio synthesis (vocoder).  We aim to improve upon Sesame AI's Conversational Speech Model (CSM) by addressing its limitations in contextual appropriateness and integrating a large language model (LLM) for enhanced conversational dynamics and emotional expression.  We will explore using a pre-trained convolutional audio encoder (like those used in EnCodec or SoundStream) or the Mimi encoder from the Moshi project for audio feature extraction before RVQ. To surpass Sesame AI's CSM, we will focus on enhancing contextual appropriateness and integrating LLM capabilities for superior voice presence.  We will explore VALL-E R optimizations (Codec Merging, Phoneme Alignment) for CSM/Vocoder speed and robustness after initial RVQ implementation (Task #201) is complete.

To surpass Sesame AI's CSM, we will focus on enhancing contextual appropriateness and integrating LLM capabilities for superior voice presence.  We will explore VALL-E R optimizations (Codec Merging, Phoneme Alignment) for CSM/Vocoder speed and robustness after initial RVQ implementation (Task #201) is complete.  The approach will involve learning the feature representation directly from the audio waveform using a neural network encoder, similar to models like VALL-E (Microsoft) and SoundStorm (Google).  We will integrate Moshi's Mimi encoder for audio feature extraction.  We will implement loading pre-trained LLM weights (e.g., Llama/Mistral) into the CSM Backbone. We will design a control token format (e.g., `[STYLE:sad]`) for prosody/emotion and update the text tokenizer to support them. We will refactor the CSM Backbone/Decoder to accept and utilize control tokens. We will update the WebSocket API and server logic for style/context parameters. We will design an initial evaluation suite (subjective & objective tests) focused on contextual appropriateness and prosody.  We will use a learned representation generated by a convolutional encoder as the input to the RVQ stage.  We will start by implementing the Mimi encoder from the Moshi project.  The approach will involve learning the feature representation directly from the audio waveform using a neural network encoder, similar to models like VALL-E (Microsoft) and SoundStorm (Google).  Models like VALL-E and SoundStorm leverage neural audio codecs (e.g., EnCodec, SoundStream, Lyra).  These codecs have their own encoder component, usually built with convolutional layers (often incorporating techniques like causal convolutions or dilated convolutions).  This encoder takes the raw audio waveform as input and transforms it into a sequence of continuous feature vectors.  These vectors represent the audio in a compressed, learned latent space optimized for reconstruction and quantization. Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) is then applied to these learned feature vectors generated by the codec's encoder to produce the discrete audio tokens. They would almost certainly use a learned representation generated by a convolutional encoder as the input to the RVQ stage.  The Mimi encoder from the Moshi project is a promising candidate for this neural audio encoder.  We will implement this encoder within our `AudioProcessor` to generate feature vectors before RVQ.  The approach taken by cutting-edge research teams typically involves learning the feature representation directly from the audio waveform using a neural network encoder, rather than relying solely on traditional, hand-crafted features like Mel spectrograms or MFCCs as the final input to the quantization stage.  Using Mel Spectrograms as the input features to our `RVQEncoder` is a viable and common intermediate step.  Starting with Mel Spectrograms as the feature extraction method seems like the most practical approach for our current task of getting the RVQ tokenizer working within `AudioProcessor`.  Given the complexity of implementing a full neural codec encoder, starting with Mel Spectrograms as the feature extraction method seems like the most practical approach for our current task of getting the RVQ tokenizer working within `AudioProcessor`.  The `kyutai-labs/moshi` repository looks highly relevant as it explicitly states it uses "Mimi, a state-of-the-art streaming neural audio codec." This is exactly the type of component we were looking for.  The repository contains a significant Rust component (`rust` directory) and mentions a `rustymimi` package. This strongly suggests a Rust implementation of the Mimi codec exists within that repository.  This significantly changes the outlook for the "Ideal Approach".  Instead of implementing an encoder from scratch, we can potentially adapt or directly use the Mimi encoder implementation from the `moshi` repository. We should investigate the code within the `rust` subdirectory to identify the specific modules related to the Mimi codec, particularly its encoder component.  We need to understand its architecture, input/output requirements (does it take raw audio `Tensor`, what are the output feature dimensions?), and how it's structured using `tch-rs` (if it uses it directly).  Based on the findings, we can plan how to integrate this Mimi encoder into our `AudioProcessor::tokenize` method, including loading its weights (likely from `.safetensors` provided by `moshi`).  The Mimi encoder's role is to transform raw audio waveforms into a compressed feature representation suitable for quantization. Therefore, it fits naturally within the audio processing pipeline, specifically before the RVQ step.  The `AudioProcessor` struct is the ideal place to manage and utilize the Mimi encoder. `AudioProcessor` will own an instance of `MimiEncoder`.  We should create a new module for the Mimi codec implementation within the `audio` directory: `src/audio/codec.rs`.  The `MimiEncoder` struct (adapted from `moshi/rust`) will reside in this new file.  The `AudioProcessor` struct will own an instance of `MimiEncoder`.  The data flow: Raw audio (`samples: &[f32]`) comes into `AudioProcessor::tokenize`. The audio is converted to a `Tensor`. This audio `Tensor` is passed to the `MimiEncoder`'s `forward` method. The `MimiEncoder` outputs a `feature_tensor`. This `feature_tensor` is then passed to the `RVQEncoder` (`self.encoder.encode(...)`). We should adjust the call to `AudioProcessor::new` in `main.rs` to provide the path to the Mimi encoder weights file, potentially via a new CLI argument or configuration.  To surpass Sesame AI's CSM, we will focus on enhancing contextual appropriateness and integrating LLM capabilities for superior voice presence. Implement a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes both subjective and objective metrics to assess the model's ability to produce contextually appropriate speech with natural prosody.

Implement a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes both subjective and objective metrics to assess the model's ability to produce contextually appropriate speech with natural prosody.  The `codebooks.npz` file is typically created during a separate training phase, not during the normal execution (inference) of the audio processing pipeline.  The file search was interrupted.  The file search was interrupted again.  The file search was interrupted again. It seems I cannot reliably locate the file this way.  The file search was interrupted again.

Using the `safetensors-cli` tool is a more direct way to inspect the contents of the `models/mimi/model.safetensors` file.  The `safetensors-cli` tool allows us to list all the tensor names (keys) stored within the file.  The command `safetensors-cli list models/mimi/model.safetensors` lists all the tensors.  The `safetensors-cli` tool is now added to the tech stack.  Implement a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes both subjective and objective metrics to assess the model's ability to produce contextually appropriate speech with natural prosody.  The `CSMModel` trait methods don't strictly need `&mut self`. They only need access (`&self`) to call the internal lock mechanism.  The standard way to resolve this when using `Arc` and interior mutability (`Mutex`/`TokioMutex`) is to keep the trait definition with `&self` and remove the `impl CSMModel for RustCsmModel` block entirely.  The `CSMImpl` implementation will handle calling the necessary methods on the inner `RustCsmModel` after acquiring the lock. The `RustCsmModel` itself doesn't need to directly implement the trait.  The `correct` fix involves these signatures: `CSMModel` trait: `&self`, `impl CSMModel for CSMImpl`: `&self`, `impl CSMModel for RustCsmModel`: `&mut self`.  This structure allows the `Arc<CSMImpl>` in `main.rs` to call the trait method with `&self` (using the `CSMImpl` implementation), which then locks the internal mutex and calls the corresponding method on the inner `RustCsmModel` using the required `&mut self`.  The project will use a learned representation generated by a convolutional encoder as the input to the RVQ stage.
