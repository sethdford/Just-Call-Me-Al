# Task Breakdown and Estimation

1. Task Definition
   - Each task in the issue tracker should represent a distinct piece of work.
   - Tasks should be clearly defined with acceptance criteria.
   - Examples: "Implement user login endpoint", "Fix button styling on profile page", "Refactor audio resampling logic".

2. Granularity
   - Break down large features or epics into smaller, manageable tasks.
   - Aim for tasks that can ideally be completed within 1-3 days.
   - Sub-tasks can be used for further breakdown if needed.

3. Estimation
   - Estimate the effort required for each task (e.g., using story points, ideal days, or t-shirt sizes).
   - Estimation helps with planning and tracking progress.
   - Be realistic and account for potential complexities or unknowns.
   - Re-estimate if the scope or complexity changes significantly during development.

4. Dependencies
   - Identify and document dependencies between tasks.
   - Plan work considering task dependencies.

5. Assignment and Tracking
   - Assign tasks to specific team members.
   - Update task status regularly in the issue tracker.
