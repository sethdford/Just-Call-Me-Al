# Audio Processing Rules

1. Sample Rates
   - Be explicit about expected sample rates.
   - Resample audio data when necessary using appropriate algorithms (e.g., sinc interpolation for quality, linear for speed).
   - Document the target sample rate for models.

2. Data Formats
   - Standardize on internal audio representation (e.g., `f32` in [-1.0, 1.0]).
   - Handle conversions from/to different bit depths (e.g., `i16`) correctly.
   - Clearly define channel handling (mono vs. stereo).

3. Buffering and Streaming
   - Use appropriate buffer sizes for streaming audio.
   - Handle backpressure in streaming pipelines.
   - Implement strategies for handling partial chunks or finalization.

4. Normalization
   - Apply normalization consistently (e.g., peak normalization) if required by models.

5. Feature Extraction (if applicable)
   - Document the feature extraction process (e.g., MFCCs, Mel Spectrograms).
   - Ensure feature extraction parameters are consistent.

6. Error Handling
   - Handle errors during audio loading, processing, and saving gracefully.
   - Provide informative error messages related to audio issues (e.g., unsupported format, resampling errors).
