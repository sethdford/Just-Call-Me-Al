def evaluate_homographs(sentence_data: Dict[str, Any], audio_transcript: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Evaluates the pronunciation of homographs in synthesized audio based on context.

    This function aims to determine if homographs within a sentence were pronounced
    correctly according to their intended meaning derived from the sentence context.
    The actual implementation will likely require phonetic analysis of the audio
    or a specialized ASR model capable of distinguishing homograph pronunciations.

    Args:
        sentence_data: A dictionary containing information about the sentence,
                       including the text, expected emotion, style, and potentially
                       explicit markers for homographs and their intended readings.
                       Example: {'id': 'sent_011', 'text': 'The lead singer took the lead.',
                                'type': 'homograph', 'emotion': 'neutral', 'style': 'neutral'}
        audio_transcript: The text transcript generated by an ASR system from the
                          synthesized audio for the sentence.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing evaluation results for homographs.
        Example: {'homograph_accuracy': 0.8, 'details': [...]}
